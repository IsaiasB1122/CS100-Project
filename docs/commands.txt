[parameters] are optional

Notes on specific paramters:
	<board>:
		When this parameter is used, the command will first check if there is a board with this exact name.
		If there is no board with that name, it will then try to treat it as an integer and use that as the board ID.
		If it doesn't match any name or ID, then the command will give an error.
